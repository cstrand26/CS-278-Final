First, you want to take the board and connect it through the handy wire that plugs into your computer's usb port.
Second, you'll want to run the handy dandy putty program provided
Third, you'll want make sure you're typing the following commands directly into the putty text window

When you press a lowercase " a-z " letter on your keyboard, you should hear a note play on one of the buzzers
The notes should go in order from left to right, starting on the bottom row and ending at the top
(" z " should be your lowest note and " p " should be your highest)

If you use " SHIFT "+ letter or use " CAPS LOCK ", the instead is saved to a loop that outputs sounds to the other buzzer
(Note that if stop at just one note, you'll create a loop only containing one note, which will sound very much like an endless long tone)
If you play the same note multiple times in a row, you'll just create a longer note
If you press the " SPACE BAR "  you'll create a rest where no note will be played
The limit of individual keystroke notes that can be saved in the loop is 255
If you press " ` ", all buzzers will immediately stop playing and the loop you created should clear

You'll notice that the notes you play with " a-z ", " A-Z ", and the rests you play with " SPACE BAR " are all the same length
If you press " + " the notes should double in length and if you press " - " their length should be cut in half
(Note that there is a limited number of preset speeds, if you press " + " while on the longest length, you should jump to the shortest
and if you press " - " while on the shortest length, you should jump to the longest)

The last thing you'll need to know is the numbers.
Pressing " 0-9 " will change the pitches " a-z " and " A-Z " will play according to different predetermined scales.
This means sometimes " z " and " Z " play " c3 " and sometimes they play " b2 "
This also means that sometimes the next note of the next octave up from " z "  is " a ", " n ", " m ", " s ", or " h " depending on how many notes are in the scale
The scales are as follows:
0 - Major C Scale (7 notes to octave)
1 - Harmonic Minor C Scale (7 notes to octave)
2 - Minor C Scale (7 notes to octave)
3 - Aeolian Dominant C Scale (7 notes to octave)
4 - Phyrgian Dominant C Scale (7 notes to octave)
5 - Major Bebop C Scale (8 notes to octave)
6 - Pentatonic C Scale (5 notes to octave)
7 - Pentatonic B Scale (5 notes to octave)
8 - Blues C Scale (6 notes to octave)
9 - Chromatic Scale (12 notes to octave)
