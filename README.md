This project is for my assembler class.

Using assembly language for the ATMega chip, this design utilizes a passive buzzer to create different pitches and uses a bit stream connection to a computer to make the computer's keyboard essentially the keyboard for a piano. The letters on the keyboard are in pitch order, numbers change the key, and capital letters add the corresponding notes to a looping backing track. Plus and Minus increase or decrease the length of the notes on said backing track, which plays exclusively from the second passive buzzer.
